I also have a firm belief that anyone who is not causing harm to others or themselves or spreading actual misinformation deserves respect.

		<h2 style="margin-left: 25px"><u><b>Other Stuff to Know</b></u></h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 75px;">
			- I brand myself around the letter H for no real reason.<br><br>
			- I can kinda draw, but my style’s sorta basic (& I also don’t draw often).<br><br>
			- I am quite sensitive, & I’m also a bit of an idiot. It’s a recipe for disaster. /hj<br>
			<div style="margin-left: 75px; margin-right: 75px;">
				- Please try to be calm & polite when giving feedback or smth. I can take jokes involving poking fun at me & all but not too much, especially when they’re about me.<br>
				- As an idiot, please be ready for me to occasionally say something too offensive or w/e on accident. Try to politely say when I go too far. (cuz genuinely, I’ll probably be forever plagued by a memory of someone saying something non-polite to me)<br>
			</div><br>
			<div style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 75px;">
			- I basically never swear in regular talking. I always use censors like asterisks (f***) or just changing the word ("f***" becomes "flip"). In talk, the asterisks are replaced with me basically quieting myself on the swear (not sure how to demonstrate this here).<br><br>
			- Speaking of which, asterisks is also my roleplay-style. I specifically use [] instead of actual asterisks (example: "Healion123: Hey there! [waves my staff while also waving at you]"). I don't really rp much outside of my friend-group, but I figured I'd say this.<br><br>
			- I separate art from the artist. I don’t support creators who do bad things but I don’t let that damage my enjoyment of what they make. This mainly applies to FNF controversies, but can totally work with other things too.<br><br>
			- Feel free to ping me for H memes. I like it<br><br>
			- On Discord specifically, there's a funny little thing I like to do where I react with the regional_indicator_h emoji whenever someone types an isolated h. If me doing it to your messages makes you uncomfortable, then tell me & I'll stop.<br><br>
			- I generally like to type with proper punctuation & grammar. It's not super formal or anything, & I <i>do</i> still use some shorteners like &, smth, etc.<br><br>
			- I suffer from self-doubt issues a sizeable bit, especially when it comes to my interests & even more so with my creative works. As of rn, IDK if it's related to anything clinical.<br>
			- My mood is pretty sensitive to negativity. Even just negative talk about smth can kinda hurt my vibe. It's definitely a me-problem but it's probably worth mentioning.<br><br>
			- I do <b>not</b> identify as a furry. I have full respect for furries, but I do not consider myself part of their community.<br>

		<p style="margin-left: 75px; margin-right: 75px;">
			- My sona encompasses a lot of the more general things that I love. Wizards, dragons, etc.<br>
			- The staff is accurately-sized in this ref sheet. When he's holding it, it's a bit taller than him.<br>
			- The hat is actually floating above his head. It <i>can</i> be knocked off & all, but it can still be moved around a lot pretty easily.<br>
			- The dancing H gif is my sona's fanonical cousin. My sona does not like him cuz he (dancing H gif) always boasts about his popularity to my sona all the time (tho the meme itself I like, dw).<br><br>
			- This sona <i>is</i> subject to change if something about me changes that may warrant design-changes to the sona or smth.<br>
