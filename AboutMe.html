			<p style="margin-left: 75px;">Hey hey hey there! I'm just your friendly neighborhood H! I try to be generally chill, positive, & have fun in life. I'm admittedly a bit socially awkward, especially IRL, but online I can be a bit more active than that. I also have a firm belief that anyone who is not causing harm to others or themselves, spreading actual misinformation, or breaking the law deserves respect.

		<h2><u><b>My OCs</b></u></h2>
		<p style= "margin-left: 50px">(Note that everything here is subject to change overtime, whether through changes in my OCs or even through the addition of more to this page!)</p>
		<h3>My Sona</h3>
		<img src="images/Healion123 ref sHeet.png" width="100%" height="100%">
		<p>
			- My sona encompasses a lot of the more general things that I love. Wizards, dragons, etc.<br><br>
			- Yes, the name is Healion123, numbers included. Buuut you <i>can</i> refer to him as just Healion for short, since he's just me ofc.<br><br>
			- My staff is accurately-sized in this ref sheet. When I'm holding it, it's a bit taller than me.<br><br>
			- The hat is actually floating above my head. It <i>can</i> be knocked off & all, but it can still be moved around a lot pretty easily.<br><br>
			- There's this joke I say where the dancing H gif is my sona's fanonical cousin. I do not like him cuz he (dancing H gif) always boasts about his popularity to me all the time. To reiterate, this is a joke. I like the dancing h gif meme<br><br>
			- Please do not ship him with other people or characters. That's just shipping an actual person with others. Cringe<br><br>
		</p><br><br>
		<h3>My JSAB OC</h3>
		<img src="images/shape-Healion ref sHeet.png" width="100%" height="100%">
		<p>
			- You can refer to this guy as "shape-Healion" to differentiate between him & me (if you refer to me as just "Healion")<br><br>
			- Want to learn more about him? Check out his <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h7_z1KHLpieYZpLC7PG4bx-4V15tSx32Z211gsLeoAM">separate lore-doc</a>.<br><br>
			- shape-Healion also used to double as my sona, until I switched to Healion123 to avoid conflicts with the lore & him (shape-Healion) also being my sona.<br><br>
			- Similar with my sona, please do not ship shape-Healion with other characters. For specifically him, he's already canonically married to a specific character. (I won't say who tho)<br><br>

		<h2><u><b>Other Stuff to Know</b></u></h2>
		<h3><b>Funni Terms I like to use</b></h3>
			<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-left: 50px;">
				- <b>i m idot/I did a stoopee -</b> I did smth a bit dumb (in a silly way)<br><br>
				- <b>Heheh -</b> Laughter. Like, genuine laughter<br><br>
				- <b>XD -</b> Same but for strong laughter. I don't use it for fake-laughter or anything<br><br>
				- <b>Hahah/eheh -</b>It's kinda sheepish laughter<br><br>
				- <b>Ya dingy! -</b> Like when you jokingly call someone dumb. Again, jokingly. Lightheartedly<br><br>
				- <b>Flip -</b> My self-censor for the F-word<br><br>
				- <b>Crarp -</b> My self-censor for the sh-word<br><br>
				- <b>I cannot brain -</b> If I'm struggling to think of smth<br><br>
				- <b>Cring/Cringg -</b> Like calling smth cringe, but not as literally<br><br>
		</p><br>
		<h3><b>Random Facts</b></h3>
			<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-left: 50px;">
				- I brand myself around the letter H for no real reason.<br><br>
				- I can kinda draw, but my style’s sorta basic (& I also don’t draw often).<br><br>
				- I basically never swear in regular talking. I always use censors like asterisks (f***), equivalents to asterisk (f### so it works easily on Discord), or just changing the word ("f***" becomes "flip"). When speaking, the asterisks are replaced with me basically quieting myself on the swear (not sure how to demonstrate this here).<br><br>
				- Speaking of which, asterisks is also my roleplay-style. I specifically use [] instead of actual asterisks (example: "Healion123: Hey there! [waves my staff while also waving at you]"). I don't really rp much outside of my friend-group, but I figured I'd say this.<br><br>
				- I separate art from the artist. I don’t support creators who do bad things but I don’t let that damage my enjoyment of what they make. This mainly applies to FNF controversies, but can totally work with other things too. If you don't do the same, I'm all good with that. Respect my preference & I'll respect yours.<br><br>
				- Feel free to ping me for H memes. I like it<br><br>
				- On Discord specifically, there's a funny little thing I like to do where I react with the regional_indicator_h emoji whenever someone types an isolated h. If me doing it to your messages makes you uncomfortable, then tell me & I'll stop.<br><br>
				- I'll randomly make jokes or references that will most likely make no sense to you. Could be a reference that you don't get, or an inside joke, or even a joke without any actual punchline. That's fully intentional, & I find it funny<br><br>

		<h2><u><b>Extras</b></u></h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 50px;">
			- This extended bio is updated sometimes, so if you think there's smth I could add or tweak in this, feel free to let me know! If you're able to see this, you most likely found me through Discord so you can just DM me there.<br><br>
			- I stream every other Saturday around 6:45am GMT over on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Healion123/streams" target="_blank">my main channel, Healion123!</a><br><br>
			- You can find some of my creative works (posted quite inconsistently) posted on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@abcdefgH123/videos" target="_blank">my 2nd channel, abcdefgH123!</a><br><br>
			- I uhh also post stuff on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HsRandomStuffvms">this 3rd channel</a> that I made for posting random stuff that wouldn't fit either of those channels<br><br>
			- I also have <a href="https://twitter.com/healion123">Twitter</a>, but I don't used it anymore outside of just linking my uploads/streams there<br><br>
			- My <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/healion123.bsky.social">Bluesky account</a>! Like Twitter, I'll be using it to further share what's on my channel, but I occasionally post more random stuff there. This may include gaming achievements, random thoughs or opinions of mine, etc. It's still pretty empty as of typing, but that'll hopefully change overtime.<br><br>
