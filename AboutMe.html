		<h2><u><b>Other Stuff to Know</b></u></h2>
		<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-left: 50px;">
			- I brand myself around the letter H for no real reason.<br><br>
			- I can kinda draw, but my style’s sorta basic (& I also don’t draw often).<br><br>
			- I am quite sensitive, & I’m also a bit of an idiot. It’s a recipe for disaster. /hj<br>
			<div style="margin-left: 75px; margin-right: 75px; font-family: Nexa Light, Georgia;">
				- Please try to be calm & polite when giving feedback or smth. I can take jokes involving poking fun at me & all but not too much, especially when they’re about me.<br>
				- As an idiot, please be ready for me to occasionally say something too offensive or w/e on accident. Try to politely say when I go too far. (cuz genuinely, I’ll probably be forever plagued by a memory of someone saying something non-polite to me)<br>
			</div><br>
			<div style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px; font-family: Nexa Light, Georgia;">
			- I basically never swear in regular talking. I always use censors like asterisks (f***) or just changing the word ("f***" becomes "flip"). In talk, the asterisks are replaced with me basically quieting myself on the swear (not sure how to demonstrate this here).<br><br>
			- Speaking of which, asterisks is also my roleplay-style. I specifically use [] instead of actual asterisks (example: "Healion123: Hey there! [waves my staff while also waving at you]"). I don't really rp much outside of my friend-group, but I figured I'd say this.<br><br>
			- I separate art from the artist. I don’t support creators who do bad things but I don’t let that damage my enjoyment of what they make. This mainly applies to FNF controversies, but can totally work with other things too.<br><br>
			- Feel free to ping me for H memes. I like it<br><br>
			- On Discord specifically, there's a funny little thing I like to do where I react with the regional_indicator_h emoji whenever someone types an isolated h. If me doing it to your messages makes you uncomfortable, then tell me & I'll stop.<br><br>
			- I generally like to type with proper punctuation & grammar. It's not super formal or anything, & I <i>do</i> still use some shorteners like &, smth, etc.<br><br>
			- I do <b>not</b> identify as a furry. I have full respect for furries, but I do not consider myself part of their community.<br>

		<h2><u><b>My OCs</b></u></h2>
		<p style= "margin-left: 50px">(Note that everything here is subject to change overtime, whether through changes in my OCs or even through the addition of more to this page!)</p>
		<h3>My Sona</h3>
		<img src="images/Healion123 ref sHeet.png" width="100%" height="100%">
		<p>
			- My sona encompasses a lot of the more general things that I love. Wizards, dragons, etc.<br>
			- Yes, the name is Healion123, numbers included. Buuut you <i>can</i> refer to him as just Healion for short, since he's just me ofc.<br>
			- The staff is accurately-sized in this ref sheet. When he's holding it, it's a bit taller than him.<br>
			- The hat is actually floating above his head. It <i>can</i> be knocked off & all, but it can still be moved around a lot pretty easily.<br>
			- The dancing H gif is my sona's fanonical cousin. My sona does not like him cuz he (dancing H gif) always boasts about his popularity to my sona all the time (tho the meme itself I like, dw).<br>
			- Please do not ship him with other people or characters. That'd make me uncomfortable.<br>
		</p><br><br>
		<h3>My JSAB OC</h3>
		<img src="images/shape-Healion ref sHeet.png" width="100%" height="100%">
		<p>
			- You can refer to this guy as "shape-Healion" to differentiate between him & me (if you refer to me as just "Healion")<br>
			- Want to learn more about him? Check out his <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h7_z1KHLpieYZpLC7PG4bx-4V15tSx32Z211gsLeoAM">separate lore-doc</a>.<br>
			- shape-Healion also used to double as my sona, until I switched to Healion123 to avoid conflicts with the lore & him (shape-Healion) also being my sona.<br>
			- Similar with my sona, please do not ship shape-Healion with other characters. For specifically him, he's already canonically married to a specific character. (I won't say who tho)<br>

			- As of writing, this extended bio is rather new, so if you think there's smth I could add or tweak in this, feel free to let me know! If you're able to see this, you most likely found me through Discord so you can just DM me.<br>			- I stream every other Saturday at 6:30am GMT over on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Healion123/streams" target="_blank">my main channel, Healion123!</a><br>
			- You can find some of my creative works (posted quite inconsistently) posted on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@abcdefgH123/videos" target="_blank">my 2nd channel, abcdefgH123!</a><br>
			- I also have <a href="https://twitter.com/healion123">Twitter</a>, but I've barely ever used it outside of just linking my uploads/streams there.<br>
